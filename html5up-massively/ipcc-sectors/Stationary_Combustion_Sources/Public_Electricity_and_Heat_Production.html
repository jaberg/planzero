        <h1>Stationary Combustion/<br />Public Electricity and Heat Production</h1>
        <p>
        Emissions from the processes and equipment of public power utilities.
        It is Canada's second-largest-emission sector.
        Emissions in this sector have been dropping, despite Canada's rising population,
        due primarily to a transition away from the use of coal.

<p>
The "Public Electricity and Heat Production" IPCC sector refers to companies whose primary business is selling electricity or heat to the grid or the public.
Emissions from this sector peaked around year 2000, and have been steadily declining since then.
</p>

<h2>Google Gemini's assessment of what causes these emissions</h2>

<ol>
    <li><b>Steam Turbines (Thermal Power Plants)</b>: a technology in which huge boilers heat water, and high-pressure steam blasts through a massive fan (turbine) to spin a generator. Coal plants are of this type, but any combustible fuel can be used.</li>
    <li><b>Combustion Gas Turbines</b>: a technology in which the expansion of combusting natural gas powers a turbine directly.
        <ul>
            <li>In <em>Peaker Plants</em>, the hot exhaust is vented, making the plant a relatively simple to construct and providing quick power for peak demand periods.</li>
            <li>In <em>Combined Cycle Gas Turbines</em>, the hot exhaust is used to drive a second steam turbine, providing a less-responsive, more-efficient electricity-generation process.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Reciprocating Engines</b>: diesel generators are commonly used to power remote communities. Gemini estimates there are roughly 200 such communities in Canada.</li>
    <li><b>District Heating</b>: Some cities, such as Toronto (Enwave) and Vancouver (Creative Energy) have district heating systems powered by huge boilers. The emissions of those boilers are counted in this sector.</li>
</ol>

</h2>

<h3>Federal Government</h3>
<p>To-do: What are this group's private problems relating to public electricity and heat?<p>

<h4>Farmers</h4>
<p>To-do: What are this group's private problems relating to public electricity and heat?<p>
<ul>
    <li>They buy electricity, much like any other commercial customer, mostly for constant energy loads
        <ul>
            <li>Running a co-located home</li>
            <li>Dairy: cooling milk, vacuum lines, water heating, ventilation</li>
            <li>Greenhouses: lighting, ventilation, robotics</li>
            <li>Poultry: lighting, ventilation, robotics</li>
            <li>Pork: lighting, ventilation, robotics</li>
            <li>Field: aeration, irrigation, robotics</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>They are able to implement behind-the-meter wind and/or solar because they tend to own lots of land, and simple buildings with big roofs.
        They can use photovoltaic power opportunistically with or without battery buffering, but loads tend to be constant rather than aligned to solar energy.</li>
    <li>Grow crops. Don't like things that shade fields, or remove water from the soil.</li>
</ul>
