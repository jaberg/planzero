        <h1>Stationary Combustion/<br />Public Electricity and Heat Production</h1>
        <p>
        Emissions from the equipment of public power utilities made electricity generation
        Canada's largest IPCC sector in 2005.
        Emissions in this sector have been dropping since then, despite Canada's rising population,
        due primarily to a reduction in the use of coal.

<p>
The "Public Electricity and Heat Production" IPCC sector refers to companies whose primary business is selling electricity or heat to the grid or the public.
Emissions from this sector peaked around year 2000, and have been steadily declining since then due primarily to a reduction in the use of coal (blue).
The use of natural gas (green) has been rising, and the use of other fuels
(e.g. diesel, light and heavy fuel oils, petroleum coke, still gas, and wood)
has remained relatively steady.
</p>

<p>
Emissions for the sector, at least for years 2005-2010, are somewhat-well-predicted by multiplying the greenhouse gas coefficients from
Annex 6 of the <a href="https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/779c7bcf-4982-47eb-af1b-a33618a05e5b">2025 national inventory report</a>,
by the amounts of each fuel used for electricity generation.
The data for the fuel usage was estimated from a few different sources:
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=2510001701">"Electric Power Generation, Annual, Fuel Consumed by Electric Utilities" (25-10-0017-01)</a>
        provided good data for years 2005-2022 for all fuel types, except natural gas
    </li>
    <li><a href="https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=2510002001">"Electric Power, Annual, Generation by Class of Producer" (25-10-0020-01)</a>
        support an accurate estimation for years 2005-2014, but only by including both utility and producer consumption.
    </li>
    <li><a href="https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=2510003001">"Supply and Demand of Primary and Secondary Energy" (25-10-0030-01)</a>
        provided natural gas consumption by electric utilities for years 2015-2024, and matches the NIR total well when only including utility consumption,
        and poorly when including both utility and industry consumption.
    </li>
</ul>
.
For natural gas though, the data from 25-10-0017-01 gave what seemed like the wrong answer.

Instead, for natural gas (at least from 2005-2014), a better estimate seemed to come from another StatsCan table:
together with some thermal efficiency assumptions
(namely that Alberta mainly used simple cycle plants with 0.3 efficiency, and Ontario used more combined-cycle plants to give average efficiency of 0.5).
For years 2015-

<h2>Google Gemini's assessment of what causes these emissions</h2>

<ol>
    <li><b>Steam Turbines (Thermal Power Plants)</b>: a technology in which huge boilers heat water, and high-pressure steam blasts through a massive fan (turbine) to spin a generator. Coal plants are of this type, but any combustible fuel can be used.</li>
    <li><b>Combustion Gas Turbines</b>: a technology in which the expansion of combusting natural gas powers a turbine directly.
        <ul>
            <li>In <em>Peaker Plants</em>, the hot exhaust is vented, making the plant a relatively simple to construct and providing quick power for peak demand periods.</li>
            <li>In <em>Combined Cycle Gas Turbines</em>, the hot exhaust is used to drive a second steam turbine, providing a less-responsive, more-efficient electricity-generation process.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Reciprocating Engines</b>: diesel generators are commonly used to power remote communities. Gemini estimates there are roughly 200 such communities in Canada.</li>
    <li><b>District Heating</b>: Some cities, such as Toronto (Enwave) and Vancouver (Creative Energy) have district heating systems powered by huge boilers. The emissions of those boilers are counted in this sector.</li>
</ol>

<h2>
    How might Canada reduce emissions in this sector to zero?
</h2>

<h3>
    Critical Success Factors
</h3>

The arithmetic of this sector is straightforward. To reduce emissions in this sector, we must
<ul>
    <li>generate less public electricity and/or public heat, and/or</li>
    <li>reduce the emissions per unit electricity produced.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
    Barriers
</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Canada's population is growing, so electricity demand is also growing.</li>
    <li>Strategies for reducing energy in other sectors often involve using electricity instead of other energy sources</li>
    <li>Rising economic productivity typically requires more energy use.</li>
    <li>
        The infrastructure of public electricity is designed around large centralized plants.
    </li>
    <li>
        Canada exports only modest amounts of electricity. Any reduction in generation probably requires a reduction in consumption.
    </li>
    <li>
        Canada is a northern country with relatively cold temperatures, and relatively little light per unit area, especially in the winter.
        The heating of buildings is a significant driver of Canada's combustion emissions,
        and the need for that heating comes at the time of year with the lowest incidence of solar energy.
    </li>
    <li>
        Canada has a wealth of fossil fuel natural resources, and decades of infrastructure to transport
        them around the country.
        Oil and natural gas heating is relatively inexpensive, compared to most other countries.
    </li>
</ul>
