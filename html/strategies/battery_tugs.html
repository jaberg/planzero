    Throughout this page, the phrase "megaCAD" is used to mean millions of Canadian dollars.
    It's a known issue with the way I'm tracking units: mega is the scientific prefix for millions, and CAD is our currency.

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>Background assumptions:
    <ul>
        <li>Log barges typically carry between 10_000 and 15_000 tons of logs, and self-unload</li>
        <li>Pacific log tugs pull barges of logs between 200 and 600 km, and return empty.</li>
        <li>Such tugs typically burn 400 l/hr while underway.</li>
        <li>Tugs typically cruise with 2000 hp, can provide up to 5000 hp.</li>
        <li>Log destinations are mainly Squamish, Nanaimo, and sites along the Fraser near Vancouver.</li>
        <li>Log sources are infrastructure-less sites around Vancouver Island, Haida Gwaii, and along the mainland BC coast.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Battery tug vessel assumptions:
    <ul>
        <li>Vessel requires a 300km range under load (about 24h), and and can charge / battery-swap at most once per day for 1-2 hours.</li>
        <li>Battery capacity required: {{ project.battery_capacity_per_tug.to('kilowatt hours') }}</li>
        <li>Vessel accommodates 8 crew.</li>
        <li>Vessel can be remote-operated to develop piloting AI, unlock future lower-cost tugs without crew quarters.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Charging assumptions:
    <ul>
        <li>The vessels can be charged for an amortized cost of $0.10/kwh, with negligible emissions.</li>
        <li>The electricity for charging can be obtained by grid power, wind turbine, or solar arrays on piers or barges.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Key predictions:
    <ul>
        <li>
            Net Present CO2e @ {{discount_rate * 100}}%: {{ "{:.3f}".format(comparison.net_present_CO2e(base_rate=(1 - discount_rate))) }} (negative means reduction)
        </li>
        <li>
            Net Present Heat @ {{discount_rate * 100}}%: {{ "{:.3f}".format(comparison.net_present_heat(base_rate=(1 - discount_rate))) }} (negative means reduction)
        </li>
        <li>
            Net Present Value @ {{discount_rate * 100}}%: {{ "{:.3f}".format(comparison.net_present_value(base_rate=(1 - discount_rate))) }} (negative means non-profitable)
        </li>
        <li>
            Net Present Value @ 5%: {{ "{:.3f}".format(comparison.net_present_value(base_rate=0.95)) }} (negative means non-profitable)
        </li>
        <li>
            Net Present Value @ 10%: {{ "{:.3f}".format(comparison.net_present_value(base_rate=0.9)) }} (negative means non-profitable)
        </li>
        <li>
            Cost per removed/avoided tonne CO2e: {{ "{:.2f}".format(comparison.cost_per_ton_CO2e(base_rate=(1 - discount_rate))) }}
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Walkthrough with Graphs</h2>

    {% endfor %}

    <h2>Future Work</h2>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>Factor in locations for charging tugs, and how exactly electricity would be generated / procured at the target price.</li>
        <li>Formalize product, estimate pricing, refine manufacturing and operating costs.</li>
        <li>Factor in a transition to autonomous tugboat vessels.</li>
        <li>Harness wind power with a retrofit to the barges? A suction sail or rotor sail could be worthwhile. Same for the tug if it is large enough.</li>
    </ul>
