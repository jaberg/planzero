I was asked recently “why are you making Plan Zero, isn’t someone else already
doing this?” The quick answer is “probably, and in many ways yes” but I wanted
to be able to articulate what those other plans were in more detail, and who
was developing them, and where might there be gaps that could be addressed by
scientific research and tech entrepreneurship. As I began to review the
history of Canada’s climate commitments and actions, and the breadth of
responses across (a) many government agencies at all levels of Canadian
government and (b) the NGO and private sector, it became clear that no
reasonably-long blog post was going to provide a survey. Indeed one of the
reasons I wanted to make planzero is that iterative software development is
a good way to build and document complex systems. Planzero is meant to reflect
all of those different kinds of plans and responses, and be built
incrementally over time. So instead of one big survey, I hope this post will
be the first of a <i>series</i> about (1) what is being done in Canada to set and
achieve climate objectives and (2) how those actions are reflected in
planzero, at least as a software library, and possibly on this website.
</p>

<p>
For this first post, I’ll start with something that’s actually beyond Canada.
One of the things that the Canadian government has done, and continues to do,
is participate in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
(UNFCCC). The UNFCCC [secretariat] is the UN entity tasked with supporting the
global response to the threat of climate change. The UNFCCC has universal
membership (198 Countries) and is the parent treaty of the 2015 Paris
Agreement. The UNFCCC is also the parent treaty of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol.
The objective of the agreements under the UNFCCC is to “stabilize greenhouse
gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that will prevent dangerous
human interference with the climate system, in a time frame which allows
ecosystems to adapt naturally and enables sustainable development.”
(<a href="https:///unfccc.int">UNFCCC website</a>)
</p>

<h2>Greenhouse Gases</h2>

<p>
One thing that the UNFCCC provides is a standard definition for what
“Greenhouse Gases” are. So-called greenhouse gases are gases in the atmosphere
that can absorb heat energy radiated by the earth’s surface (like the heat you
feel when your hand is close to something warm, like maybe a teapot) that
might otherwise be radiated into outer space. When these gases are present in
the atmosphere at elevated concentrations, their effect is to absorb more of
the radiated heat, which traps the heat within the earth’s atmosphere. Glass
has a similar effect when used as the roof of a greenhouse: sunlight radiates
in, but heat accumulates instead of radiating out (up until a new equilibrium).
This effect on a greenhouse is to warm it
up inside. The effect of greenhouse gases on the planet is complex in some
ways, but also does involve warming up (except that continued emissions keep making the roof a better and better insulator!)
</p>

<p>
Before we get into the effects of greenhouse gases, let’s repeat here that the official UNFCCC greenhouse gases are:
<ul>
    <li><b>Carbon Dioxide (CO2)</b>: naturally occurring, but concentrations have
    been trending upward since industrial revolution due to increasing fossil
    fuel combustion</li>
    <li><b>Methane (CH4)</b>: naturally occurring, but also about 80% of what’s
    marketed as “natural gas” fuel and often leaked during oil
    extraction.</li>
    <li><b>Nitrous Oxide (NO2)</b>: largely associated with fertilizer use</li>
    <li><b>“F-gases”</b> associated with industrial processes and manufacturing:
        <ul>
            <li>Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)</li>
            <li>Perfluorocarbons (PFCs)</li>
            <li>Sulfur Hexafluoride (SF6)</li>
            <li>Nitrogen Trifluoride (NF3)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
A note on plan zero software:
Plan Zero models emissions over time of these gases. Each is
a SparseTimeSeries object contained within the State object representing
a temporal simulation. The state contains a lot of SparseTimeSeries objects
but they all have unique names. The annual GHG emissions of carbon dioxide are
stored (at time of writing) in the one called
“Predicted_Annual_Emitted_CO2_mass”. The `AtmosphericChemistry` class defines
each of these SparseTimeSeries objects as the sum of annual sectoral emitted
CO2 masses, which are themselves defined as the temporal integral of sources
registered for each sector.
</p>

<h2>Planetary Heating Model</h2>
<p>
The Planzero software includes a simple model of the relationship between greenhouse gas emissions and planetary heat and temperature.
Planzero doesn't model the atmosphere, or oceans, or land, except in an extremely simplified way.
It models how average gas concentrations in the atmosphere change over time (e.g. years),
and it models how excess trapped heat (relative to pre-industrial revolution trapped heat) raises the average shallow ocean temperature.
In slightly more detail:
<ul>
    <li>The ocean is modelled as a giant heat battery with a single uniform temperature, which is called the ocean temperature anomaly.</li>
    <li>The ocean is modelled as uniformly 200m deep, and therefore with heat capacity 1.5e23 Joules / Kelvin.</li>
    <li>Heat is assumed to be radiated at a rate that is proportional to the ocean temperature anomaly.</li>
    <li>The [global] atmosphere is modelled as being at all times uniformly mixed.</li>
    <li>The atmosphere is assumed to have no heat capacity, temperature, or internal dynamics.</li>
    <li>The land surface is not modelled at all in any physical sense.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Carbon Dioxide</h3>

<p>
Carbon dioxide
(<math display="inline">{{blog.equations["CO2"] | safe}}</math>)
is  modelled as a stable atmospheric mass and an emitted mass.
The atmospheric mass is considered indefinitely stable, with no assumption of a natural decay mechanism.
The emitted mass is considered to be partly absorbed into e.g. vegetation and shallow waters at a rate of 55%, with the remaining 45% taken up into the indefinitely stable atmospheric mass.
The 55% term models e.g. average surface alkalinity, and the amount of carbon dioxide required to change surface water concentration to match the changes in atmospheric concentration.
</p>
<p>
The remaining 45% of emissions of 
<math display="inline">{{blog.equations["CO2"] | safe}}</math>
are converted to an atmospheric concentration, and then converted to a partial radiative forcing contribution of
<math display="inline">{{blog.equations["CO2_df"] | safe}}</math>
<math display="inline">{{blog.equations["W_m2"] | safe}}</math>,
in which 
<math display="inline">{{blog.equations["C"] | safe}}</math> is the current
concentration of 
<math display="inline">{{blog.equations["CO2"] | safe}}</math>
in the atmosphere, and
<math display="inline">{{blog.equations["C0"] | safe}}</math> is the pre-industrial level
of 280 ppm.
This number of watts per unit area is multiplied by the surface area of the earth, and integrated over time to get a partial energy imbalance due to
<math display="inline">{{blog.equations["CO2"] | safe}}</math>.
That energy is modelled as being absorbed into the upper ocean, raising its temperature.
</p>


<h3>Methane</h3>
<p>
Methane is a naturally occurring gas in the atmosphere at low concentration,
but it also about 80% of what’s marketed as “natural gas” fuel and often
leaked during oil
extraction.
It is also produced in signifant quantity by
the digestive process of bovines, such as dairy and beef cattle.
</p>
<p>
Methane
(<math display="inline">{{blog.equations["CH4"] | safe}}</math>)
is modelled differently from carbon dioxide.
Methane emissions are modelled as completely mixing with the atmosphere
as soon as they are emitted,
and atmospheric methane is modelled as being continuously broken down into
carbon dioxide and hydrogen
at a rate proportional to the amount of methane currently present:
<math display="inline">{{blog.equations["delta_C_left"] | safe}}</math>
=
<math display="inline">{{blog.equations["CH4_delta_C_right"] | safe}}</math>.
This gives our atmospheric methane a half-life of about 8.5 years.
When a molecule of modelled methane breaks down,
it yields a molecule of carbon dioxide, which is counted as a carbon dioxide emission.
</p>

<p>
The radiative forcing math for methane is different from carbon dioxide as well.
Methane is modelled as contributing
<math display="inline">{{blog.equations["CH4_df"] | safe}}</math>
<math display="inline">{{blog.equations["W_m2"] | safe}}</math>,
where
<math display="inline">{{blog.equations["C"] | safe}}</math> is the current
and
<math display="inline">{{blog.equations["C0"] | safe}}</math>
are the current and pre-industrial atmospheric concentrations of methane respectively,
in units of parts-per-billion
(<math display="inline">{{blog.equations["C0"] | safe}}</math>
= 722 ppb).
As with the partial radiative forcing contributed from our modelled carbon dioxide,
this quantity is multiplied by the surface of the earth, integrated over time,
and used to heat the shallow water of our simulated ocean.
</p>

<h3>Nitrous Oxide</h3>
<p>
Nitrous oxide
(<math display="inline">{{blog.equations["NO2"] | safe}}</math>), largely associated with fertilizer use,
is modelled similarly to methane, but with a slower decay,
and a larger radiative forcing coefficient.
In reality, atmospheric nitrous oxide is broken down by UV light, but only once it reaches very high levels of the atmosphere. When that happens, it decays into
either (a) nitrogen and oxygen, 90% of the time or else (b) nitric oxide, 10% of the time.
Nitric oxide is notable because it breaks down ozone, but anyway planzero does not model that.
In the planzero simulation, nitrous oxide is modelled as simply disappearing,
at a rate proportional to the amount of it currently present:
<math display="inline">{{blog.equations["delta_C_left"] | safe}}</math>
=
<math display="inline">{{blog.equations["NO2_delta_C_right"] | safe}}</math>.
This gives our atmospheric nitrous oxide a half-life of about 80 years.
</p>

<p>
Radiative forcing due to nitrous oxide is similar to methane.
Nitrous oxide is modelled as contributing
<math display="inline">{{blog.equations["NO2_df"] | safe}}</math>
<math display="inline">{{blog.equations["W_m2"] | safe}}</math>,
where
<math display="inline">{{blog.equations["C"] | safe}}</math> is the current
and
<math display="inline">{{blog.equations["C0"] | safe}}</math>
are the current and pre-industrial atmospheric concentrations of nitrous oxide respectively,
in units of parts-per-billion
(<math display="inline">{{blog.equations["C0"] | safe}}</math>
= 270 ppb).
As for the other gases, this quantity is multiplied by the surface of the earth, integrated over time,
and used to heat the shallow water of our simulated ocean.
</p>

<h3>F-gases</h3>

<h4>Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)</h4>

<p>
Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) are synthetic chemicals used primarily as alternatives to ozone-depleting substances in refrigeration, air conditioning, and insulating foams.
According to the Montreal Protocol, there is a global phase-down of production
of these chemicals, as they can become potent greenhouse gases.
The only IPCC sector with which they are associated is called
"Production and consumption of Halocarbons, SF6, and NF3", but Canada has reported
non-zero emissions quantities in this area.
</p>
<p>
HFCs are modelled in planzero as having a pre-industrial reference concentration of 0.
They are modelled as simply disappearing according to linear process with a 14-year time constant.
<math display="inline">{{blog.equations["delta_C_left"] | safe}}</math>
=
<math display="inline">{{blog.equations["HFC_delta_C_right"] | safe}}</math>.
In terms of radiative forcing, they are modeled as  contributing
<math display="inline">{{blog.equations["HFC_df"] | safe}}</math>
<math display="inline">{{blog.equations["W_m2"] | safe}}</math>,
where
<math display="inline">{{blog.equations["C"] | safe}}</math> is the current concentration in parts-per-billion.

</p>

<h4>Perfluorocarbons (PFCs)</h4>
<p>
Perfluorocarbons (PFCs), like HFCs, are strictly man-made (mostly from
aluminum smelting and semiconductor manufacturing) and exist in the atmosphere
at very low concentrations (parts per trillion).
However, they differ from the gases above in one important way: they have
almost no natural sinks,
so their atmospheric lifetimes are estimated in the range of thousands of years.
They are also relatively potent greenhouse gases.
</p>

<p>
PFCs are modelled in planzero as having a pre-industrial reference concentration of 0.
They are modelled as never disappearing or decaying, but simply accumulating.
In terms of radiative forcing, they are modeled as  contributing
<math display="inline">{{blog.equations["PFC_df"] | safe}}</math>
<math display="inline">{{blog.equations["W_m2"] | safe}}</math>,
where
<math display="inline">{{blog.equations["C"] | safe}}</math> is the current concentration in parts-per-billion.
</p>

<h4>Sulfur Hexafluoride (SF6)</h4>
<p>
Sulfur Hexafluoride (SF6) is used primarily as an electrical insulator in
high-voltage switchgear. It is modelled similarly to PFCs:
its decay time constant is estimate to be on the order of thousands of years,
and it is even more potent as a greenhouse gas than PFCs or HFCs.
</p>

<p>
Sulfur hexafluoride is modelled in planzero as having a pre-industrial reference concentration of 0.
It is modelled as never disappearing or decaying, but simply accumulating.
In terms of radiative forcing, it is modeled as  contributing
<math display="inline">{{blog.equations["SF6_df"] | safe}}</math>
<math display="inline">{{blog.equations["W_m2"] | safe}}</math>,
where
<math display="inline">{{blog.equations["C"] | safe}}</math> is the current concentration in parts-per-billion.
</p>



<h4>Nitrogen Trifluoride (NF3)</h4>
<p>
Nitrogen Trifluoride (NF3) is the last of the "major" synthetic
greenhouse gases named by the UNFCCC, whose emissions member countries are required to track.
It is primarily used
in the manufacturing of liquid crystal displays (LCDs), solar panels, and
semiconductors.In terms of modeling, it behaves almost exactly like SF6
and PFCs: it is a man-made, long-lived, and extremely potent gas
that operates in the linear radiative forcing regime.
</p>

<p>
Nitrogen hexafluoride is modelled in planzero as having a pre-industrial reference concentration of 0.
It is modelled as never disappearing or decaying, but simply accumulating.
In terms of radiative forcing, it is modeled as  contributing
<math display="inline">{{blog.equations["NF3_df"] | safe}}</math>
<math display="inline">{{blog.equations["W_m2"] | safe}}</math>,
where
<math display="inline">{{blog.equations["C"] | safe}}</math> is the current concentration in parts-per-billion.
</p>

<h2>CO2e and GWP 100</h2>

<p>
In policy and reporting, it is awkward to continuously reason about time-trajectories of future heating, which are different for different emissions.
The concept of CO2-equivalence (CO2e) is a simplification that turns the emissions of all of the greenhouse gases into a single number, such that bigger the number is, the more heat is expected to be trapped.
A CO2e value is nominally in kilograms, but it isn't really a thing with mass.
It is a mathematical shorthand computed by weighting
the sum of masses of different greenhouse gases,
by a so-called Greenhouse Warming Potential (GWP) coefficient representing how much a common mass of each gas has the potential to warm the planet over a 100-year period, relative to carbon dioxide.
</p>
<p>
Planzero estimates the total CO2e for a set of GHG emissions over a certain amount of time (e.g. a year) as
<ul>
    <li>1 x the mass of carbon dioxide emissions</li>
    <li>28 x the mass of methane emissions </li>
    <li>265 x the mass of nitrous oxide emissions </li>
    <li>1,430 x the mass of HFCs </li>
    <li>6,630 x the mass of PFCs </li>
    <li>23,500 x the mass of SF6 </li>
    <li>17,200 x the mass of NF3 </li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>How closely do the Planetary Heat model and CO2e estimates match?</h3>


<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>
This concludes the first post about what Canada is doing toward net-zero emissions,
namely, participating in the UNFCCC, and using standard definitions of
greenhouse gases.
The next post, will be about something the federal government has done in legislation, namely,
in 2021, committing Canada to net-zero emissions targets by year 2050.

Until then,
