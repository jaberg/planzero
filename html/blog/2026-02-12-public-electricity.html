<h2 id="h2_intro">Introduction</h2>

High-level reminder to the reader (and myself!): I would like for PlanZero to be able to evaluate business and product ideas in terms of their ability to support Canada's net-zero targets.
I believe the best strategy for this is
<ol>
    <li>approximating to the official national inventory calculation based on public data from Statistics Canada (StatsCan) and Natural Resources Canada (NRCan), and then</li>
    <li>estimating the effect of hypothetical business and product ideas in terms of those foundational StatsCan and NRCan statistics.</li>
</ol>
Over the coming weeks, I intend to make progress on bullet 1 above ("approximating...") by iterating through the International Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC's) guideline sectors in order of decreasing magnitude in the 2005 emissions baseline,
making time-boxed efforts to replicate each one as well as possible.
I might sneak in some effort toward bullet 2 above (estimating) to reassure myself that my efforts on bullet 1 are helping, but I'm trying to stay focused on bullet 1: approximating the national inventory calculation.
This post is the first in a series that will develop an approximation to Canada's national greenhouse gas inventory.
It introduces the set of sectors uses by Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC), and replicates the calculation of emissions associated with "Public Electricity and Heat"
for years TODO to TODO. Much of the content of this post has been used to refresh the
<a href="/ipcc-sectors/Stationary_Combustion_Sources/Public_Electricity_and_Heat_Production/">IPCC Sectors / Public Electricity and Heat Production</a> page.
</p>

<h2 id="ipcc_sectors">IPCC Sectors Guidelines</h2>

<p>
Canada's National [Greenhouse Gas] Inventory is reported in keeping with the 
<a href="https://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2019rf/index.html">2019 Refinement</a> to the
<a href="https://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/index.html">2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories</a>.
At the highest two levels, the IPCC reporting guidelines are organized as follows:
<ul>
    <li><b>Energy</b>
        <ul>
            <li>Stationary combustion</li>
            <li>Mobile combustion</li>
            <li>Fugitive emissions</li>
            <li>CO2 transport, injection, and storage</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Industrial Processes and Product Use</b>
        <ul>
            <li>Mineral industry emissions</li>
            <li>Chemical industry emissions</li>
            <li>Metal industry emissions</li>
            <li>Non-energy products from fuels and solvent use</li>
            <li>Electronics industry emissions</li>
            <li>Emissions of fluorinated substitutes for ozone-depleting substances</li>
            <li>Other product manufacture and use</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Agriculture, Forestry, and Other Land Use</b>
        <ul>
            <li>Forest land</li>
            <li>Cropland</li>
            <li>Grassland</li>
            <li>Wetlands</li>
            <li>Settlements</li>
            <li>Other land</li>
            <li>Emissions from livestock and manure management</li>
            <li>N2O emissions from managed soils and CO2 emissions from lime and urea application</li>
            <li>Harvested wood products</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Waste</b>
        <ul>
            <li>Waste generation, composition, and management data</li>
            <li>Solid waste disposal</li>
            <li>Biological treatment of solid waste</li>
            <li>Incineration of solid waste</li>
            <li>Wastewater treatment and discharge</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
The IPCC guidelines describe how countries should measure greenhouse gases in all of these areas, including further sub-areas.
For example, within stationary combustion (within energy), the 2006 guideline 
(<a href="https://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/pdf/2_Volume2/V2_2_Ch2_Stationary_Combustion.pdf">pdf</a>)
enumerates 20-or-so coded sub-categories that countries can elect to use to characterize their emissions,
including e.g. electricity generation, petroleum refining, manufacturing industries and construction, and combustion within commercial and residential buildings.
For more examples, within mobile combustion, the 2006 guidelines enumerate vehicle types from consumer cars and trucks, to heavy duty diesel-burning trucks, to off-road vehicles used in mining,
to emissions from rail, aviation, and marine vessels.
The guidelines from 2006 were evidently largely clear and complete, because they weren't updated until 2019 and even then the updates appear to be relatively minor. Good job, IPCC.

<h2 id="canada_sectors">Canada's IPCC Sectors</h2>

<p>
Canada reports emissions in terms of 71 IPCC sectors, the complete set of which is listed below.
We saw the IPCC Sectors making up Canada's emissions in the previous post.
The stacked area figure had a coloured region for each sector, emphasizing the sectors with the largest emissions in terms of CO2e.
There is variance: the magnitude of emissions from sector to sector and year to year can sometimes vary by over 10% of Canada's entire emissions (especially the land use sectors).
There is also consistency: historically we see a lot of emissions
from stationary and mobile combustion of fossil fuels for energy, and almost-negligible
emissions associated with several sectors, such as e.g. industrial wastewater treatment and discharge, the incineration and open burning of waste, and, of all things the transportation and storage of CO2.
</p>

<p>Admittedly it makes for dry reading, but for completeness, here are the 71 IPCC sectors with which Canada represents its greenhouse gas inventory:

<p>
The emissions in these sectors make up Canada's national greenhouse gas inventory.
The total reported annually to the Secretariat of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) excludes the LULUCF contributions, but the federal targets set by Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) are inclusive of all 71 sectors.
My intention with PlanZero is to replicate / approximate the emissions in each of these sectors, roughly in order from largest to smallest in 2005.
</p>

<h2 id="public_electricity">Public Electricity and Heat</h2>

<p>
The largest single-sector contributor of CO2e in 2005 in Canada was the stationary combustion of fossil fuels for the purpose of producing public electricity and public heat.
This was responsible for 124 megatonnes of CO2e (MtCO2e) that year, almost all of which was actually carbon dioxide, rather than other greenhouse gases.
Public electricity dominated the emissions, rather than public heat, although there are district heat systems in Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver, and this sector should include their emissions.
The emissions of public electricity generation are mostly from coal (heating water, creating steam to drive a turbine) and from natural gas (usually injected straight into a combustion turbine like a jet engine,
sometimes with the heat being used to also drive a steam turbine).
</p>

<p>
The stacked bar chart in the figure above is my first attempt to approximate the ECCC's sector total in the national inventory report submitted to the UNFCCC.
It's close-ish, not perfect; sometimes over, sometimes under.
Not shown in the colors is the breakdown by coal type, province / territory, and specific types of "other fuels",
although those subtotals are in the underlying data from Statistics Canada.
</p>

<p>
Emissions for the sector were generally calculated by multiplying greenhouse gas emission factors by amounts of fuel combusted.
The data for this estimate comes from a handful of sources:
<ul>
    <li>Annex 6 of the <a href="https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/779c7bcf-4982-47eb-af1b-a33618a05e5b">2025 national inventory report</a> lists the emissions factors for different fuels,
        sometimes varying by year, by province, by application, or by combustion technology (e.g. residential vs. industrial wood combustion).
    </li>
    <li><a href="https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=2510001701">"Electric Power Generation, Annual, Fuel Consumed by Electric Utilities" (StatsCan 25-10-0017-01)</a>
        provided data for years 2005-2022 for all fuel types, except natural gas.
    </li>
    <li><a href="https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=2510002001">"Electric Power, Annual, Generation by Class of Producer" (StatsCan 25-10-0020-01)</a>
        supported an accurate estimation for years 2005-2014 relating to natural gas, but only by including both utility and industry consumption.
        To use this data source, I had to approximate natural gas consumption using thermal efficiency assumptions:
        by default I assumed 30% for plants in Alberta (conjecturing that steam would be used to move heat into oil sands rather than create additional electricity), and 50% for Ontario (where more combined-cycle turbines were in operation).
    </li>
    <li><a href="https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=2510003001">"Supply and Demand of Primary and Secondary Energy" (StatsCan 25-10-0030-01)</a>
        provided natural gas consumption by electric utilities for years 2015-2024, and allowed my estimate to approximately match the NIR total when only including utility consumption.
        In contrast to the years for which I used of StatsCan 25-10-0020-01, the estimates for later years using this data were poor when including both utility and industry consumption.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
The emissions of each gas were combined into CO2e using the non-time-dependent coefficients introduced in the <a href="./2026-01-21-unfccc">earlier PlanZero post on GHGs</a>.
I did not include the contribution to this sector from district heating systems  (e.g. in Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver), as the impact of these systems on the national calculation
appears to be smaller than the current fitting error.
</p>

<p>
It is encouraging to see the downward trend over the last two decades in emissions from this sector, but the figure shows only 17 more MtCO2e of annual emissions from coal combustion can be eliminated.
The strategy of replacing coal plants with natural gas turbines is reducing emissions for now, but the strategy will not get us to net zero.
Troublingly, the emissions from natural-gas-powered plants have been rising sharply in recent years.
I have yet to incorporate the emissions projections from the provincial and territorial utilities,
but based on this recent investment in gas turbine capacity, I expect emissions in this sector to remain in the 40-60 MtCO2e range for many years.
Unless there's a huge breakthrough in carbon sequestration,
we will have to find sources of lower-emission electricity both to handle ever-increasing demand, as well as to replace those gas turbine plants as they reach end-of-life in the decades ahead.
</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>
This post introduced the sectors recommended by the IPCC reporting guidelines, and enumerated all 71 sectors used by the ECCC to represent Canada's national greenhouse gas inventory.
It presented the first attempt in PlanZero to replicate a sectoral emissions calculation from that national inventory: public electricity and heat.
The basic mathematics of the emission calculation is straightforward: a weighted sum of amounts of fuel consumed multiplied by emissions factors of each greenhouse gas for each fuel.
The implementation is complicated by the emissions factors being presented in various sizes and natures of tables, and by the fuel consumption being stored in multiple
StatsCan products covering different time periods, and with overlapping but somewhat different semantics.
Still, the required data seems by and large to be public, and the prescribed arithmetic gave rise to roughly the desired result.
I look forward to complementing and extending the time series involved in this calculation with the emissions projections from provincial and territorial electric utilities, and modelling
how Canada might be powered in the decades to come, but I won't do these things just yet.
Coming up in the next post will be a similar modelling summary of Canada's next-largest emissions-contributing sector from 2005: forest land.
